## Welcome to the Test Page

This is a test website for Teco Education's "Find My Student Type" Application. 

You can check the website at: https://youngil-1013.github.io/

Note:
It takes a few minutes (usually 5 to 10) for the .io website to reload. If something doesn't seem to work, check for alerts at Setting->(Scroll to)Github Pages Section. If nothing is wrong, the section head should read " Your site is published at https://youngil-1013.github.io/". If not, it should guide you to the error page.

For testing the HTML, CSS and JS together, I recommend JSFiddle at: https://jsfiddle.net/. Simply copy paste the code into corresponding section.
